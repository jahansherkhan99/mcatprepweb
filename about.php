        <p>Hello my name is Jahansher Khan and I am a graduate from Tufts University with a B.S in Computer Science and a 3.94 science GPA. I decided I'm going to help out other fellow pre-meds by facilitating active learning by making quizzes for content we must know. I will be building more resources as well to help pre-meds so stay tuned! This is just the beginning.</p>
